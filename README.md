# Reliability Test Timeline Generator

This is a Streamlit tool that auto-generates reliability test timelines based on selected processes, a start date, and predefined turnaround times (TAT) for each sub-process.
It is designed to simplify QAWR test planning, highlight key milestones, and produce clear Gantt-style charts for tracking progress.

Run the app locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) to view it in your browser.
